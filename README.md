# LipNet
## Predicts text from Lip movement from a video stream

Based on the paper 'LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading': https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01599

Based on Pytorch instead of Keras. 

### Things to note:
1) The model is not trained on all the data available at: http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gridcorpus/ , due to heardware constraints ( donot have a discrete gpu and online gpu availabilities time out in between)
2) Couldnt train for more epochs and fine-tuning is not carried out, again dur to hearware limitations
